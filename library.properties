sentence=Closed-loop RC DAC using GPIO, op-amp, and MOSFET with analog feedback.
paragraph=ServoDAC implements a closed-loop RC DAC driven by timed GPIO charge and discharge pulses, using analog feedback to stabilize the output voltage. It is designed for Arduino-class microcontrollers and is suitable for experimental DACs, control loops, and instrumentation.
